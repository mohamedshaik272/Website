                <ul>
                    <li>Led development of an innovative file management solution by architecting a cross-platform
                        desktop application using Svelte, Tauri, Python and Rust that intelligently classifies and
                        organizes files, reducing digital clutter by 30% and saving users an average of 45 minutes per
                        week in file searching tasks.</li>
                    <li>Tackled complex file classification problems by designing and implementing ML-based
                        categorization algorithms with custom rule engines, achieving 80% accuracy in automated file
                        sorting during test environments and processing batches of 500+ files simultaneously with
                        minimal system resource usage.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Identified learning gaps for 25+ undergraduate students struggling with core CS concepts by
                        developing personalized learning assessments and adapting teaching styles to individual needs,
                        resulting in a 99% satisfaction rate and average grade improvements of 18% across algorithms,
                        data structures, and OOP courses.</li>
                    <li>Addressed complex concept comprehension challenges by creating visual learning materials and
                        interactive coding exercises for topics including recursive algorithms, tree traversals, and
                        dynamic programming, enabling 80% of students to independently solve similar problems on
                        subsequent assignments.</li>
